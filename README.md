# JSONPowerDB

### Title: Student Enrollment Form using JSONPowerDB

### Description

This project creates a simple web-based student enrollment form that stores data in a JSONPowerDB database. The form collects information such as Roll No, Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date. The data is then stored in the STUDENT-TABLE within the SCHOOL-DB database.

### Benefits of Using JSONPowerDB

*   **Lightweight and easy to use:** JSONPowerDB is a simple JavaScript library that doesn't require a complex setup or installation.
    
*   **No server-side database required:** All data is stored locally in a JSON file, making it convenient for small-scale applications.
    
*   **Flexible data structure:** JSONPowerDB allows for flexible data structures, making it easy to adapt to changing requirements.
    
*   **Offline functionality:** Since data is stored locally, your application can still function even without an internet connection.
